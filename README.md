## Super Star Trek for PicoCalc (sst_pc.bas)

Super Star Trek was the very first computer game I played on a Russian PDP 11/40 clone (a TPA 11/40). I found a port for PicoCalc here: https://github.com/madcock/PicoCalcBasic which I refined a little bit. Here are my contributions:

* Fixed a bug that was in the code since 1974, where torpedo and navigation trajectories were not calculated correctly (if you used the direction provided by the on-board computer which was correct, you would miss with the torpedo or end up in the wrong place if you used it for navigation)
* Fixed a bug where the Klingons would not attack
* Made the "graphical" screens look more consistent
* Changed the color from light grey to green (which is how I played it on the VT-100 terminal back in the days)
* Color coded the stars, Klinglons and starbases, because PicoCalc has colors
